# GENERATING NEW FONTS TUTORIAL
## NOTICE:
 * arguments in "" are placeholders *others* are to be copy-pasted
 * helping scripts and programs are run from the root directory of the project
 * Language names are not translated, so non-ascii characters contained in these names are not in *.po files. They are added in the lang.py script (line:242)


## Preparation
1. It is necessary to aquire list of non-ascii symbols that are currently being used by the printer. Non-ascii symbols can be generated via utils/translations_and_fonts/lang.py script
```bash
mode           - Script is actually capable of doing multiple things -h will show you the
input-dir      - Given argument should contain pre-generated files required; the directory needs to contain po files with translations
output-dir  - Two files will be generated there,  non-ascii-chars.txt/.raw containing necessary characters
```

2. New pngs with all ascii symbols and the non-ascii that were generated in the previous step are required.
 * !!! Symbols not found in the source pngs will be replaced with black squares at the end of the generated pngs in the following steps
 * !!! Source png needs to be of RGB type

 * Save source pngs to src/gui/res/fnt_src

# Generating

1. Run utils/translations_and_fonts/font.py. This script will generate png containing only symbols actually used in the translations:
```bash
non_ascii_chars  - path to non-ascii-chars file generated in previous steps, only the .txt variant works; "{path}non-ascii-chars.txt"
src_png             - path to source pngs with all necessary symbols; if source png is not of RGB type, script will return ERROR; "src/gui/res/fnt_src/{name}"
char_width          - pixel width of given font
char_height         - pixel height of given font
dst_png             - destination path with name of the to be gnerated png;" src/gui/res/fnt_png/{name}"; convention is "font_{type}_{w}x{h}.png" e.g. "font_bold_9x16.png"
ipp_path            - destionation path with name of the to be generated ipp file; ipp file contains indexes of non-ascii chars within generated png, therefore all generated ipps should be identical
    One ipp file needs to be inlcuded within the "src/guiapi/include/fnt-indices.ipp", there is no problem with it being rewritten multiple times.
```

2. Build tests; run this form project root directory
```bash
mkdir -p build_tests
cd build_tests
../.dependencies/cmake-3.82.3/bin/cmake -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=YES -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS="-O0 -ggdb3" -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O0 -ggdb3 -std=c++20" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
cd utils/translations_and_fonts/png2font
make
```

3. Run build_tests/utils/translations_and_fonts/png2font/png2font
```bash
-src   - "src/gui/res/fnt_png/{name}.png" path to the png generated in step 1); png containing only symbols used by the printer
-dst   - "src/gui/res/fnt_png/{name}_preview.png" path where preview of the font will be generated. Basically the same png, just inverted colours (white letters on black).
-out   - destination of .bin files generated by the program; these will be used in the next step so name them properly; bin files will not be saved to git, they can be saved wherever
-bpp - bits-per-pixel; the colour depth of given png
-w     - pixel width of given font
-h     - pixel height of given font
-c     - number of columns in png generated in previous step; seems to be always "16"
-r     - number of rows in png generated in previous step
```

4. Run utils/translations_and_fonts/bin2cc.py
```bash
src_filename - path to the .bin file from previous step
dst_filename - "src/gui/res/cc/{name}.hpp" destination of .hpp file to be included; name of header file should correspond used png file from step 1
type         - type of given font; e.g. "15px-LiberationMono-regular_9x16.png" -> type = regular
width        - pixel width of given font
height       - pixel height of given font
```

5. Redo steps 1-4 for all fonts that are to be changed
6. At last chang includes in src/gui/fonts.cpp to the ones just added and cleanup unused ones

# Alternatively included bash script can be used to do all above
The script expects:
1. Preparation steps are all done
2. Source pngs are named * / \{type}_\{w}x\{h}.png e.g. "15px-LiberationMono-regular_9x16.png"
3. Script is run from root directory of project

```bash
w           - pixel width of given font
h           - pixel height of given font
type        - type of font used
```
