 *  \brief USB class driver for the USB-IF CCID class standard.
 *
 *  \section Sec_USBClassCCID_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Device/CCIDClassDevice.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *
 *  \section Sec_USBClassCCID_ModDescription Module Description
 *  CCID Class Driver module. This module contains an internal implementation of the USB CCID Class, for Device USB
 *  mode. User applications can use this class driver instead of implementing the CCID class manually via the low-level
 *  LUFA APIs.
 *
 *  This module is designed to simplify the user code by exposing only the required interface needed to interface with
 *  Devices using the USB CCID Class.
 *
 *  \warning
 *  LUFA is not a secure USB stack, and has not undergone, not is it expected to pass, any form of security audit. The
 *  CCID class here is presented as-is and is intended for research purposes only, and *should not* be used in a security
 *  critical application under any circumstances.
