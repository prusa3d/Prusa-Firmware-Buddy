 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  CCID demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB CCID device. If you want to test this
 *  in Linux, you must change the following file:
 *  /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist
 *  and add a VID, PID and friendly name.
 *
 *  This device was not tested on Windows.
 *
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function
 *  as a CCID device with one slot already inserted. Upon detection, the device
 *  will send an ATR to the device, which can use it to determine
 *  host capabilities. Developers can use user applications to send APDUs
 *  back and forth to the device
 *
