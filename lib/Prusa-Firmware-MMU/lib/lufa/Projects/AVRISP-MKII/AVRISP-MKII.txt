 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description
 *
 *  Firmware for an Atmel Studio compatible AVRISP-MKII clone programmer. This project will enable the USB
 *  AVR series of microcontrollers to act as a clone of the official Atmel AVRISP-MKII programmer, usable within
 *  Atmel Studio or with any software capable of driving a real Atmel AVRISP-MKII programmer. In its most
 *  basic form, it allows for the programming of AVR TINY, MEGA and XMEGA devices at the programmer's VCC voltage from
 *  within Atmel Studio with no special hardware other than the USB AVR and the parts needed for the USB
 *  interface. If the user desires, more advanced circuits incorporating level conversion can be made to allow for the
 *  programming of target AVRs running at a different voltage to the programmer.
 *
 *  This device spoofs Atmel's official AVRISP-MKII device PID so that it remains compatible with Atmel's AVRISP-MKII
 *  drivers. It is currently tested working under the following configurations:
 *
 *    - <b>Windows:</b> Atmel Studio 7, with alternative driver
 *    - <b>Windows:</b> AVRDUDE 6.2, with alternative driver
 *    - <b>Linux:</b> AVRDUDE 6.1
 *
 *  <b>Note that this clone requires a libUSB based driver under Windows,</b> due to an incompatible change in the official
 *  Jungo based driver. The alternative driver given here will function with both real and clone AVRISP devices in Atmel
 *  Studio 7 onwards under Windows - and as a bonus, also provides AVRDude access to the programmer.
 *
 *  As of Atmel Studio version 7.0.1417 the legacy Jungo driver has been deprecated in favor of an official libUSB based
 *  driver, making the driver packaged here superfluous. Use the driver packaged here only if you are still using an earlier
 *  Atmel Studio 7 build, otherwise the official Atmel libUSB driver should be used.
 *
 *  Note that this design currently has the following limitations:
 *    - No reversed/shorted target connector detection and notification
 *    - A separate header is required for each of the ISP, PDI and TPI programming protocols that the user wishes to use
 *
 *  On AVR models with an ADC converter, the USB AVR's AVCC pin should be tied to 5V (e.g. VBUS) and the
 *  \c VTARGET_ADC_CHANNEL token should be set to an appropriate ADC channel number in the project makefile for VTARGET
 *  detection to operate correctly. On models without an ADC converter, VTARGET will report a fixed 3.3V level at all times
 *  which should allow the programmer to remain compatible at the protocol level with all AVR devices.
 *
 *  While this application can be compiled for USB AVRs with as little as 8KB of FLASH, for full functionality 16KB or more
 *  of FLASH is required. On 8KB devices, ISP or PDI/TPI protocol programming support can be disabled to reduce program size.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Installation Installation
 *  The programmer supports multiple platforms, both Windows and Linux.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_LinuxInstallation Linux Installation
 *  On Linux systems, the programmer should be usable out of the box with no special setup other than (on some systems)
 *  editing of the system permissions to allow the programmer to be used from a non-elevated (root) context. The programmer
 *  is compatible with the free open source AVRDude programming software project.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_WindowsInstallation Windows Installation
 *  On Windows systems, due to an unfortunate limitation of the USB AVR devices and the Atmel Studio platform, the programmer
 *  requires an alternative libUSB based driver. Uninstall the existing Jungo driver for the device (if installed) and replace
 *  it with the driver that ships with this project, to enable access to the programmer in Atmel Studio and AVRDUDE.

 *  In addition, the AVR's OCR1A pin will generate a 4MHz clock, to act as an external rescue device clock if the
 *  fuses have been mis-set. To use the recovery clock, connect the OCR1A pin of the USB AVR to the target AVR's
 *  XTAL1 pin, and set the ISP programming speed to 125KHz (note: other ISP speeds will not work correctly).
