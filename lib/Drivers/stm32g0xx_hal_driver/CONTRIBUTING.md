- [ ] `Make sure your issue is a question/feedback/suggestions RELATED TO the software provided in this repository.` Otherwise, it should be discussed on the [ST Community/STM32 MCUs forum](https://community.st.com/s/group/0F90X000000AXsASAW/stm32-mcus).
- [ ] `Make sure your issue is not already reported/fixed on GitHub or discussed on a previous issue.` Please refer to this [dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/STMicroelectronics/projects/2) for the list of issues and pull-requests. Do not forget to browse into the **closed** issues.

### 2. Posting the issue
When you have checked the previous boxes. You will find two templates (Bug Report or Other Issue) available in the **Issues** tab of the repository.

### 3. Pull Requests
STMicrolectronics is happy to receive contributions from the community, based on an initial Contributor License Agreement (CLA) procedure.

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you are sure **you own the intellectual property**, then you need to sign an Individual CLA (https://cla.st.com).
* If you work for a company that wants also to allow you to contribute with your work, your company needs to provide a Corporate CLA (https://cla.st.com) mentioning your GitHub account name.
* If you are not sure that a CLA (Individual or Corporate) has been signed for your GitHub account you can check here (https://cla.st.com).

Please note that:
* The Corporate CLA will always take precedence over the Individual CLA.
* One CLA submission is sufficient, for any project proposed by STMicroelectronics.

#### How to proceed

* We recommend to engage first a communication thru an issue, in order to present your proposal. Just to confirm that it corresponds to STMicroelectronics domain or scope.
* Then fork the project to your GitHub account to further develop your contribution. Please use the latest commit version.
* Please, submit one Pull Request for one new feature or proposal. This will ease the analysis and the final merge if accepted.
