 * \brief Lightweight compile-time generated stream-parsing automata.
 *
 * We often need to parse network protocols using very little memory. As
 * strange as it seems, there probably aren't libraries matching our needs in
 * this area.
 *
 * We want to:
 * * Have small code footprint.
 * * Have very small state per-connection. That means not buffering eg. all the
 *   headers, etc.
 * * Be able to suspend and recover parsing anywhere (since data arrive in
 *   chunks and are split in arbitrary place).
 *
 * Lucky for us, a lot of network protocols are rather old and simple. That
 * means, it is easy to parse using quite simple automata. Furthermore, most
 * strings in the protocols (header names, method names, URLs of endpoints we
 * understand, ...) are known in advance and we can just ignore/not make
 * distinction between the others. That means the specific strings may be part
 * of that automaton too. Therefore, we can get away with just the state ID in
 * that automaton + few target variables for storing extracted values in
 * already parsed form (ID of a method or an endpoint in a numerical form, some
 * number).
 *
 * Therefore, the idea is we describe the parser in a python script using some
 * kind of grammer-like/parser-combinator-like DSL and let it generate an
 * automaton we'll use, subscribe to events it generates (entering/leaving
 * certain interesting states). We can feed the automaton char by char and keep
 * only the state around.
 *
 * # Technicalities
 *
 * For practical reasons, we don't store the automaton in the "pure
 * mathematical" definition, but in somewhat compressed form. For that reason,
 * a single transition in our case can be triggered by multiple different
 * characters. Also, it is possible to embed longer string "paths" that don't
 * have a separate state on each character.
 *
 * For technical reasons, paths are present in states, not in transitions and a
 * path forms kind of implicit transition in itself.
 *
 * The searching algorithm:
 *
 * * First tries if it can advance on the path. If it reaches the end of the
 *   path, it advances to a state with index current + 1 (the implicit
 *   transition).
 * * If there's no path or it can't be advanced (warning! this can "exit" the
 *   path in the middle of it), it tries all transitions available from the
 *   state. The first matching one is taken. Therefore, it is possible to have
 *   more specific transitions first, less specific ("fallbacks") later.
 * * If no transition is found, the given character is refused and the
 *   automaton doesn't move.
 * * Note that if a path is left "in the middle", it doesn't "return" back and
 *   try the transitions, they are consumed and lost forever. In case this
 *   greediness is not desired, the automaton needs to be "shaped" differently.
 *
 * If either the just left or just entered state is marked, an event with
 * details is emited and the caller can consume it. If both the entered and
 * left states are marked, only one event is generated.
 *
 * # Representation
 *
 * * The states and transitions are represented in the well-known two-array
 *   form of adjacency list. Each state points to the first transition leaving
 *   it, the next state forms a stopper for them (and there's one "dummy" state
 *   at the end).
 * * The generator must ensure no index is ever out of bound (eg. no invalid
 *   target states in transitions, etc).
 * * The whole representation is read-only and is generated as const tables
 *   during compile time. An Automaton class can be put on them to interpret
 *   them.
 * * It is assumed that the tables are static (available for the whole lifetime
 *   of the program), as are instances of the Automaton class.
 * * The data structures for the tables are somewhat packed to save space.
 * * We assume textual protocols here; it could be adapted for binary ones too,
 *   but we would save less bits in the packing. It is still assumed binary
 *   data may arrive over the wire (which would be violation of the protocol or
 *   in some
 * uninteresting place, but will not "blow up").
