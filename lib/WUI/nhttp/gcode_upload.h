 * This adapts the old gcode upload hack to the new server. This is not exactly right way to do it, though, we want to:
 * * Support multiple simultaneous uploads.
 * * Figure a way to not inject printer-specific types into the generic server (even though it's just by listing the handler somewhere).
 * * Generalize uploading files for whatever reason.
 * * Not go C->C++->C->C++â€¦
 * * Not having several dynamic allocation layers on the way and somehow flatten it.
 * * Propagate error _reasons_ out of the upload state.
 *
 * Flattening this one and the Uploader together might be a good idea.
