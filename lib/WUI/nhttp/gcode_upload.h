 * \brief A handler to accept incoming gcodes.

 * This will take a POST request with valid form containing gcode and store it
 * onto the USB drive.
 *
 * Note that this adapts the old gcode upload hack to the new server. There are
 * many things that should be improved or refactored, this was just the fastest
 * way to glue the old code in. Specifically, we want to:
 * * Support multiple simultaneous uploads.
 * * Figure a way to not inject printer-specific types into the generic server (even though it's just by listing the handler somewhere).
 * * Generalize uploading files for whatever reason (may go hand in hand with the above?).
 * * Not go C->C++->C->C++â€¦
 * * Not having several dynamic allocation layers on the way and somehow flatten it.
 * * Propagate error _reasons_ out of the upload state.
 *
 * Flattening the Uploader in here might go part of the way.
