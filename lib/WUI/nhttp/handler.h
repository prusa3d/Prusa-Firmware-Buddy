/**
 * \file
 *
 * The handler framework for the HTTP server.
 *
 * A handler is part of handling of a HTTP request. It can read some data,
 * write some data and then pass the bucket to some other handler. Eventually
 * it reaches a termination handler.
 *
 * We put all the handlers into a variant. Note that they do _not_ inherit from
 * some common interface/ancestor, they only have to provide the correct
 * methods to be usable.
 *
 * * `want_read` - the handler wishes to receive some data from the client.
 *   Note that the wish may change during the lifetime of the handler.
 * * `want_write` - the handler wishes to send some data to the client. Note
 *   that the wish may change during the lifetime of the handler.
 * * `step` - performs one step of computation. Depending on the wishes
 *   (signaled by the above methods) and what is available (data from client,
 *   send buffers), it is called with at least one of data from client and a send
 *   buffer (of at least the size specified in constant in the Server class),
 *   possibly with both. It shall do some progress and specify how much it did
 *   and what shall be done next.
 *
 * It is allowed (and preferred) to write some data and signal the end right
 * away (if the data fits), the server will handle the delivery while letting
 * the next handler perform what it needs doing.
