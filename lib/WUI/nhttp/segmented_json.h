/// Support for rendering JSON by parts.
///
/// If possible, prefer the use of JsonRenderer. This one is more low level and
/// can be used when the JsonRenderer is too limiting. But this one is more
/// error prone (it's easier to create inconsistent response).
///
/// Sometimes, we may not afford to send the whole JSON answer in one packet
/// and we have only a single packet of buffer space. Therefore, we need to be
/// able to store just enough of state to be able to generate a consistent
/// reply and then allow suspending at places.
///
/// This supports suspending between individual JSON fields. We still assume
/// we'll be able to put at least the field inside the buffer (that is, no extra
/// huge strings).
///
/// The user inherits this, adds the state and provides the content function.
///
/// This does not validate the produced JSON in any way (and probably could be
/// used to render something else than JSON, actually).
///
/// Few notes for implementers:
/// * The idea behind the content function is that it tries to call methods on
///   the provided output until it returns ContentResult::Incomplete. Then the
///   content function returns and it'll get called in the future with a new buffer
///   and the resume_point parameter set to whatever was passed to the output that
///   didn't fit. This can be used to jump to the right place and continue from
///   there (retrying the one that didn't fit).
/// * A switch over the resume_point may be used to "jump" to the right place.
///   But the switch is used _without_ breaks, to continue with the next outputs.
/// * The implementation of the content function is a bit awkward. Therefore,
///   we also provide the segmented_json_macros.h header with helpful macros.
///   These take care of generating the right switch with jumping to the
///   resumed position. It is in a separate header that can be included only in
///   the .cpp file, while including this file into another header file without
///   polluting the namespace with macros.
/// * The test cases in tests/unit/lib/WUI/nhttp/segmented_json_rendering.cpp
///   contains an example how to use this.
///
/// Note that state that needs to survive between resumption either needs to be
/// stored in the object or re-computed at the start of the content method (but
/// it gets recomputed on each resume, therefore it should produce the same or at
/// least compatible results).
///
/// Also note that there's no way to "restart" the renderer.
