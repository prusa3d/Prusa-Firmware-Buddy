 * The http handlers.
 *
 * These are the functions that provide the dynamic content. They are not
 * supposed to have any knowledge of the actual HTTP or its implementation as
 * far as possible.
 *
 * They are passed to the HTTP server to serve the content. This also allows to
 * plugging some mocks to do the server part.
 *
 * The server is initialized with a pointer to the HttpHandlers structure. The
 * ownership is _not_ passed to the server, and it is required the structure
 * lives at least as long as the server.
 *
 * All the handlers get the structure as their first parameter. This can be
 * used to pass additional data using the "C-style inheritance" pattern (well,
 * C++ inheritance would work  too). Note that the requests share the structure
 * and therefore this is not the right place for per-request scratch pad.
 *
 * The real application can use the `default_http_handlers` for the server.
