https://github.com/intel/cpp-std-extensions/blob/main/include/stdx/concepts.hpp[`concepts.hpp`]
implements various https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts[standard concepts]. In C++17 they are surfaced as compile-time
boolean values.

NOTE: For compatibility with the standard and with
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_base_of[`std::is_base_of`], a class
is considered to be `derived_from` itself.

Also one non-standard but useful concept: `callable`. `callable` is modelled by
functions by and objects with `operator()`. In particular it is true for generic
lambda expressions, where `operator()` is a function template.
