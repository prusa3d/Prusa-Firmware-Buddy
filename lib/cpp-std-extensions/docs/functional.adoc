`with_result_of` is a class that can be used for lazy evaluation.
`with_result_of` wraps a callable (often a lambda expression) and can
implicitly convert to the return type of the callable. It may be passed to
functions that perfectly forward their arguments - a good example is an
`emplace` function on a container - and the conversion happens only when the
required value is actually used.

----
// S is a type that is some work to construct
// so we use a maker function
struct S { ... };
auto make_S() -> S;

std::unordered_map<int, S> m;

v.emplace(0, make_S()); // this works, but incurs a temporary construct, move and destruct
v.emplace(0, stdx::with_result_of{make_S}); // this constructs S in-place thanks to RVO
----

`with_result_of` can help to achieve in-place construction, effectively by deferring
evaluation of function arguments.
