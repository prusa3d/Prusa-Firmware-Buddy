== Introduction

`stdx` has several aims:

* Where possible, to enable using parts of the C++ standard library in versions
  earlier than when they were introduced, and where standard library
  implementations are lagging behind the standard.
* To provide a common interface across C++ versions such that preprocessor
  directives in application code are minimized.
* To provide implementations of standard behaviour that are richer or more
  efficient -- at either compile-time or runtime -- than the standard versions.
* To provide useful functionality that is missing from the C++ standard but
  arguably belongs at a base level.

=== Compiler and C++ version support

The following compilers are supported:

* clang 14
* clang 15
* clang 16
* clang 17
* gcc 12
* gcc 13

In general, `stdx` supports the C++17 standard; however some functionality is
available only in 20 and later.

=== Synopsis

Everything is in the `stdx` namespace. Where suitable, functionality is grouped
into headers whose names match the standard.
