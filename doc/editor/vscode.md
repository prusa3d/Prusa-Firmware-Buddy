    - `CMake Tools` (handles configuring and building the project),
    - `Cortex-Debug` and `Cortex-Debug: Device Support Pack - STM32F4` (support for debugging of the firmware),
    - and `ccls` extension, which provides autocompletion and code navigation.
2. Install [ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) on your system
    - Linux: `sudo snap install ccls --classic` ([full instructions](https://snapcraft.io/ccls))

        1. Download our precompiled binaries from [here](https://prusa-buddy-firmware-dependencies.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/windows_tools.zip).
        2. Unzip them to `C:\Tools` so your file structure looks like this:

            ```
            C:\Tools

             â””â”€â”€ lsp-ccls

### FAQ

#### OpenOCD: Error: Can't find interface/stlink.cfg

Most likely, your OpenOCD is too old (or let's rephrase it - not new enough). The general solution is to uninstall it and build it from source yourself! Yay! ðŸ’ª

1. `git clone https://github.com/ntfreak/openocd.git`
2. And follow the instructions in the readme (your are mostly interested in `OpenOCD Dependencies` and `Compiling OpenOCD`).
