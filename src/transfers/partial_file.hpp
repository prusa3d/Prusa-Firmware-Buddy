/// Partial File manages a FatFS file that can be read & written at the same time.
///
/// - The file is always contiguous on the drive.
///     - This makes a lot of things easier, but we won't be able to use all the space on the drive if it's fragmented.
/// - The file, once created, can be read by standard means (fread etc)
///     - To observe which parts of the file are valid for reading, use the `get_valid_head` and `get_valid_tail` methods.
/// - To write to the file, use the `write`, `seek` and `flush` methods.
///     - The file remembers which parts of the file are valid. But there are limitations in order to keep the implementation simple.
///     - It remembers up to 2 valid independent parts. No more.
///     - One of them is called the "head", which is a part starting at offset 0.
///     - Second one is called the "tail" and it's a part starting somewhere in the middle of the
///         file (gradually growing to the end of the file).
///     - Creating a third valid part (by writing somewhere in between the head and the tail, for example) is not allowed.
///     - Therefore, every write should either extend the head or the tail.
///     - At some point, when the head and the tail meet, they are merged (tail is extended to the start of the file
///         and head is extended to the end of the file).
///     - Writing uses low-level USB functions and has basic buffering implemented by this class. Some requirements:
///         - seek() is allowed only to the start of a sector
///         - consecutive writes gradually fill the sector
///         - when a sector is fully written to, it's flushed to the drive
///         - seek()  to a different sector while the current one hasn't been fully written to will discard the currently buffered data
///
/// Thread safety:
/// - Getting the state (and related methods) are thread safe - it can happen concurrently to writes from other thread.
