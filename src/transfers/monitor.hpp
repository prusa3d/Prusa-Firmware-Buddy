/// The monitor of transfers.
///
/// This holds info about the currently running transfer of a file (from Slicer
/// / Link / Connect), if any. It also holds some (significantly reduced) info
/// about some past transfer(s) ‒ mostly, just their outcome.
///
/// The purpose is to share the information between threads and reserve the
/// single active transfer, in a thread-safe way.
///
/// It is meant to operate in a single instance (which is bundled inside) in
/// normal operation. It is however not a true singleton ‒ it is possible to
/// create an instance independent of the global one, which might be useful for
/// example in testing.
///
/// # Expected usage
///
/// The thread that desires to perform a transfer tries to claim the slot by
/// the allocate method. These may fail when the slot is already taken. If
/// successful, caller is supposed to hold onto the returned object for the
/// time of running the transfer and push all updates to it through that
/// object. Once the object is destroyed, the transfer is considered done and
/// the slot is returned.
///
/// Nevertheless, under normal circumstances, the thread shall call the done
/// method on the Slot to record how it finished.
///
/// Any observing thread may, at any time, call the status method to obtain
/// info about currently running transfer. This can return nullopt in case no
/// transfer is running.
///
/// # Lifetimes and locking
///
/// The user of this should be aware of few implementation details here.
///
/// * While the Slot is expected to be a long-living object (held for the whole
///   duration of the transfer), this is not the case for the Status object.
///   That one holds an exclusive lock on the monitor, so it can guarantee the
///   values won't change during its lifetime. But that also means it blocks
///   other threads from doing anything with the monitor at the same time. As a
///   result, the user shall not keep a Status alive for extended periods of
///   time and shall drop it (and re-acquire as needed) across any network
///   communications or other slow operations.
/// * As a consequence, the values between two Statuses may be different. It is
///   recommended to check that the transfer ID stays the same.
/// * As another consequence, calling the allocate method or dropping the Slot
///   while the same threads holds a Status will deadlock. It is, however,
///   possible (and expected) to get a Status after the thread acquired the Slot
///   and it is guaranteed that the Status will be for the same transfer as the
///   Status.
/// * Similarly, calling methods on the Slot while holding a Status will deadlock.
/// * Neither Status nor Slot are allowed to outlive the Monitor they came from
///   (not an issue with the global instance, of course).
/// * Any pointers or references acquired from a Status is valid only for as
///   long as the Status itself is alive.
/// * The outcome and current_id are independent of the main locking and
///   never deadlock.
