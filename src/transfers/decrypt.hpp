    // The return size may differ slightly due to:
    // * The cipher works in blocks. We may have a leftover from the last time.
    //   The output might be up to BlockSize - 1 larger, but it'll never cross a
    //   multiple of BlockSize boundary above the size. That is, if the real
    //   buffer is Block-Size multiple large, it'll never overflow (but if the
    //   amount of data passed in into the function is smaller than this/not of
    //   multiple of block size, it may "round up" to the nearest boundary size).
    // * The first use of the decryptor will never increase the size.
    // * The last block might be smaller (the total that goes out might be
    //   smaller than the total that goes in) due to padding at the end.
    //
    // In other words, to use correctly:
    // * Use a buffer that's a multiple of BlockSize
    // * Pass the data in through that buffer, specifying the amount of data available.
    // * Process the amount returned from the function.
